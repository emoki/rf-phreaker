The License is effective upon your opening of this package and
shall remain in effect until terminated. You may terminate the
License at any time by destroying Encodix together with all
copies, modifications, and merged portions in any form. The

Encodix is confidential and proprietary information of
Dafocus. You agree to take adequate steps to protect the
Program from unauthorised disclosure or use.


6. LIMITED WARRANTY

Dafocus warrants that the media on which Encodix is
furnished will be free from defects in materials and workmanship
under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date
of delivery to you as evidenced by a copy of your sales receipt.

Dafocus does not warrant that Encodix will meet your
requirements or that the operation of Encodix will be
uninterrupted and error free. You are solely responsible for the
selection of Encodix to achieve your intended results and for
the results actually obtained.

Dafocus's entire liability and your exclusive remedy under this
limited warranty shall be, at Dafocus's option, to replace the
defective media, or to refund the price paid for Encodix,
provided you return the defective product promptly to Dafocus
with a copy of your sales receipt.


7. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, Dafocus
DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT
TO Encodix AND MAINTENANCE OR OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL Dafocus BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR
OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
Encodix OR OF ANY ACTION OR OMISSION OF Dafocus OR ITS
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY NON-PERFORMANCE
OF THE MAINTENANCE OR OTHER SERVICES, EVEN IF Dafocus HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE
PROGRAM FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. This limitation of
liability shall not apply to claims for bodily injury or damages
to real or tangible personal property for which Dafocus is
legally liable.


9. EXPORT REGULATIONS

Software, including technical data, may be subject to export or
import regulations in other countries including the United States
Export Administration Act. You agree to comply with all such laws
and regulations.


10. GENERAL

You agree that the License is granted on the condition that the
applicable price for your copy of Encodix is duly paid.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more of the
provisions of this General Terms and Conditions shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.
However, if in Dafocus's opinion such deletion of any provision
of this General Terms and Conditions unreasonably compromises the
rights or liabilities of Dafocus, Dafocus reserves the right
to terminate the License and/or the maintenance service and
refund the License fee paid by you as your sole and exclusive
remedy.

In the event special terms have been agreed in writing between
you and Dafocus, then such terms take precedence over this
General Terms and Conditions in case of inconsistency.

Should you have any questions concerning this General Terms and
Conditions, this License, or maintenance or other services, or if
you desire to contact Dafocus for any reason, please write
to Dafocus, via Dei Mandorli, 6 - 20090 Cesano Boscone (MI) - Italy
