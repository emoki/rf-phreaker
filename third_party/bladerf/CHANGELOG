 2014.09-rc2 (2014-07-24)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 2014.09-rc1, there have been a number of bug fixes.  We wanted to ensure
these fixes were provided at a relatively stable "snapshot" in the codebase,
prior to introducing a slightly large of set of internal changes required
to provide the timestamp support and thread-safety.

As such, these changes are have been marked `2014.09-rc2`, and the late-August
milestone has been been renamed to `2014.09-rc3`. The objectives for the
late-August and September and milestones remain.

This release candidate consists of the following versions:
* FPGA bitstream v0.0.6
* FX3 firmware v1.7.1
* libbladeRF v0.16.2
* bladeRF-cli v0.11.1

In addition to continued fixes and minor improvements, the remaining
major functionality, now scheduled for RC3 is:
    * Metadata/timestamp support for the libbladeRF synchronous interface
    * Experimental Cypress driver-based libbladeRF backend for Windows

The above items will add additional items to the libbladeRF API, but will not
introduce any reverse-incompatible changes.

The items scheduled for deprecation are largely the same since 2014.09-rc1
    * bladeRF-flash has been removed as of 2014.09-rc2
    * libbladeRF's BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16Q11 will be removed prior to 2014.09-rc3

Outstanding tasks and known issues, as of RC2, are listed below. Note that not
all of these are scheduled for resolution by 2014.09. Please see the milestone
and tracker information GitHub for more information.

 2014.09-rc1 (2014-07-05)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first of two release candidates for a 2014-09 release. RC1 consists
of the following component versions:

    FPGA bitstream  v0.0.5
    FX3 Firmware    v1.7.0
    libbladeRF      v0.16.0
    bladeRF-cli     v0.11.0

This release candidate provides a majority of the functionality scheduled for
the 2014.09 release. The remaining functionality, scheduled for RC2 is:

    * Metadata/timestamp support for the libbladeRF synchronous interface
    * Detection and reporting of incompatible firmware/FPGA versions
    * Experimental Cypress driver-based libbladeRF backend for Windows

The above items will add additional items to the libbladeRF API, but will not
introduce any reverse-incompatible changes.


The following items are schedule for deprecation and removal prior to the
2014.09-rc2 release:

    * bladeRF-flash utility
        - A majority of the functionality provided in this program now overlaps
          with bladeRF-cli. This program was used to ease the burden associated
          with some very early firmware upgrades.

          However, for firmware upgrade issues, the well-documented bootloader
          approach is now preferred. This, combined with efforts to have
          libbladeRF be more explicit about version mismatches, should eliminate
          any remaining need for this program.

    * libbladeRF's BLADERF_FORMAT SC16_Q12 reverse compatibility macro
        - The format is now more appropriately named BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16_Q11.
          Ensure you've replaced references to the old enumeration value.


Outstanding tasks and known issues, as of RC1, are listed below. Note that not
all of these are scheduled for resolution by 2014.09. Please see the milestone
