Hello Lev, 
 
    I need Visual Studio C++ compatibility for asn1c output files. The structure definitions within parameter lists are warnings with gcc, but errors for VS due to scoping issues. For example: 
 
    A_SEQUENCE_OF(struct xyz { 
 
             int x; 
 
             int y; 
 
             int z; 
 
    }) list; 
 
  will not compile under VS, unless I change to: 
 
      struct xyz { intx; int y;; int z;}; 
 
      A_SEQUENCE_OF(struct xyz) list; 
 
Short of post-processing all the asn1c file output, do you have a better solution? 
 
Thanks, 
   Kevin

Modify your ASN.1 file to move the specification out of SEQUENCE OF. I.e., if you have SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE { ... } replace it with the following: 
 
SEQUENCE OF FOO 
 
Foo ::= SEQUENCE { ... }

for rajesh:
svn login, 
ipp library documentation,
lte dll
